# 🧩 Provider Refactor App

A simple Flutter counter app refactored to use **Provider** for app-wide state management instead of `setState()`.  
This project demonstrates how to separate UI and logic using **Provider architecture** for cleaner, scalable Flutter code.

## 🚀 Features

- Refactored from `setState()` to `Provider`
- Centralized app-wide state with `ChangeNotifier`
- Uses `context.watch()` and `context.read()` for efficient rebuilds
- Clean folder structure (providers + screens)
- Reactive UI that automatically updates when state changes
